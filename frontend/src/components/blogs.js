  For the past year, we have been working in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as a team. The main aim behind this was to develop advanced RAG systems to solve real-life issues, along with creating an environment where everyone can be familiar with RAG techniques and new updates on Generative AI and in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs).
  Our goal is to raise awareness about the latest and unexplored technologies through our social media accounts. You can follow us and stay updated on the latest advancements in LLMs, chatbots, and emerging technologies.
